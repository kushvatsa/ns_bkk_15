#Network science Project 15
Imagine, that a group of travelling salesman wants to visit all public transport stations in Budapest. They want to accomplish this task as quickly as possible. So they hook up the map of Budapest, locate the stations and start to plan their visits. They can use only public transport to reach the stations except in the first step, where they can start at any station.

In the first planning round they build the network of the stations by connecting that ones where at least one public transport line connects the two stations. On this networks they try to find the optimal starting nodes (stations) from which they can reach all nodes with the minimal number of steps. The steps are counted by the number of stations that they enter or travel through as they use the public transport lines. 

Depending on the size of the group (number of salesmen in the group) try to make a station-visiting plan, which results the minimal number of steps, which is needed to visit all the stations for the group! Try to minimize to sum of the steps taken by all members of the group, and try to minimize the number of steps, which is taken by the member who makes to most steps in the group!

Compare your result with a reshuffled network!
